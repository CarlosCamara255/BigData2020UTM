# Explain the impact of data today:
for the new fundamental technologies that change the way we gather, store, analyze and transform information.

# Explain the causes for which data generation has increased:
The speed of data generation accelerates and the value associated with it decreases over time. If it is not processed in real time, companies have to face lost opportunities with financial implications and, sometimes, especially in industrial IoT scenarios, they can lead to fatal situations.

# Define the concept of Big Data:
It is a term that describes the large volume of data, both structured and unstructured.

# Differentiate between open data and private data:
Open data means that anyone can access and can use that information as they please, instead private data only have access to certain people as employees or members of an organization and whose access is restricted.

# Differentiate between structured and unstructured data:
Structured data is mostly found in the database, they are text files that usually show in rows or columns with titles, unstructured data in general are binary data, it is a massive and disorganized conglomerate of several objects that have no value until it is identified.

# Differentiate between stored data and moving data:
The stored data are those found in a database without being passed from one side to the other, and the moving data are those that are being transmitted on a network.

# Define the meaning of data analysis:
Data analysis is used in several industries to allow companies and organizations to make better business decisions and is also used in science to verify or fail existing models or theories.

# Explain the impact of data analysis in organizations:
Improve the information you have available to help us make decisions. Convert the application data into visual representations helping customers describe concepts, discover opportunities, explore options and make more optimal decisions, all carried out by a very persuasive means.

# Explain the different types of data analysis:
|               |Type of data|Analysis|Examples|
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------:| -------------:|
|Qualitative|It focuses on opinions, attitudes and beliefs.|Questions and answers to questions like: Why, how?|Panels where an argument is given and consumers are interviewed about what they like or not in the place.            
|Quantitative|It focuses on hard data and information that can be accounted for.|It is obtained through questions similar to: How many? Who? How often? Where?|Surveys focused on measuring sales, trends, reports or perceptions.|

# MapReduce:
It is a programming framework model used to support parallel computing.

# Hadoop:
It is an open source software structure for storing data and running applications.

# Apache spark
It is an open cluster computing system, unified analysis engine, ultrarapid for Big Data.
